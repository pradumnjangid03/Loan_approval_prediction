# Loan Approval Prediction Model

This project trains a machine learning model using Scikit-learn to predict loan approvals. It includes preprocessing for both categorical and numerical features using pipelines, and saves the model using `joblib`.

## 📁 Files
- `model_train.py`: Python script that trains the model
- `loan.csv`: Input dataset
- `loan_pipeline_web.joblib`: Saved ML model

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- VS Code

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install required libraries:

2. Run the training script:


3. The trained model will be saved as `loan_pipeline_web.joblib`.
